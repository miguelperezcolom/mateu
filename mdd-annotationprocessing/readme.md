## Annotation processing

One part of the UI is handled by code generated by Mateu, using java annotation processing
on classes annotated with `@MateuUI`.

This module contains the annotation processor for `@MateuUI` which, basically, generates 3 classes 
for each `@MateuUI` annotated class:

- a rest controller for all the Mateu API endpoints
- a rest controller for serving the index.html file
- a class for adding `io.mateu` to Spring's component scanning

I use freemarker templates for this.

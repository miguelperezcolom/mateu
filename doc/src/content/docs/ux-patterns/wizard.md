description: Guide sequential flows with inter-step dependencies.
---

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Intent

Guide sequential flows where each step depends on what was chosen in earlier steps.

## Problem

An onboarding flow where step 3 depends on what was selected in step 1 cannot be safely collapsed into one large form — the user could advance without completing required choices, or see irrelevant fields. Jumping between pages with no intermediate validation breaks the flow.

## Solution

Extend `Wizard` and declare one field per step; each field's type must implement `WizardStep`. Mateu renders the current step's form, a progress bar, and navigation buttons automatically.

```java
// Each step is a plain class or record implementing WizardStep
public class AccountTypeStep implements WizardStep {

    @NotNull
    AccountType accountType;
}

public class CompanyDetailsStep implements WizardStep {

    String companyName;
    String vatNumber;
}

// Result step — read-only screen shown after completion
public class OnboardingResult implements WizardStep {

    @PlainText String summary = "Account created successfully.";
}

// The wizard class
@UI("/onboarding")
public class OnboardingWizard extends Wizard {

    AccountTypeStep step1 = new AccountTypeStep();
    CompanyDetailsStep step2 = new CompanyDetailsStep();
    OnboardingResult result;   // null → auto-instantiated after @WizardCompletionAction

    @WizardCompletionAction
    @Action(validationRequired = true)
    Object finish() {
        accountService.create(step1, step2);
        result = new OnboardingResult();  // optional: set explicitly for custom data
        return null;
    }
}
```

## How it works

| Step position | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Any intermediate step | Shows **Next →** (and **← Back** after step 1). Validation runs on **Next →**. |
| Penultimate step | Shows the `@WizardCompletionAction` button instead of **Next →**. |
| Last step | **Read-only result screen.** No navigation buttons. Progress bar shows 100 %. |

The last step is instantiated automatically with its default field values if it is `null` when `@WizardCompletionAction` returns — or the wizard can set it explicitly inside the completion method.

The wizard **title** is derived in order: `@Title` annotation → `TitleSupplier.title()` → class name.

## Structure

```
Account setup                         ← getTitle()
[●────────────────────] Step 1 / 3   ← progress bar

  Account type: ○ Personal  ● Business

                            [Next →]
```

```
Account setup
[────●────────────────] Step 2 / 3

  Company name: ___________
  VAT number:   ___________

  [← Back]            [Create account]   ← @WizardCompletionAction
```

```
Account setup
[──────────────────────●] Done

  ✓ Account created successfully.
                                         ← no navigation buttons
```

## Principles served

- **Progressive complexity** — each step shows only what is needed at that moment
- **Recoverability** — validation fires before advancing, not at the end
- **Workflow over screens** — the wizard models a task, not an entity

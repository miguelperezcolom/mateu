title: Feature parity matrix
description: What each server (Java, .NET, Python) and each renderer supports today.
---

Mateu's contract is the wire: any server can serve any renderer. Coverage differs by
implementation — this page is the honest snapshot, and the single place to update when something
is ported. ✅ full · 🟡 partial (see note) · — not yet.

## Servers

The Java server is the reference implementation; the .NET and Python servers emit the same wire
for the surface below (verified by golden-JSON tests in `backend/dotnet/test` and
`backend/python/tests`).

| Feature | Java | .NET | Python |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forms, sections, field types, validation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| CRUD (list / detail / edit / new / save / delete) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| App shell + menus + navigation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Wizards (incl. branching) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Page decorations (subtitle, banners, badges, KPIs, FABs) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tabs, stereotypes, shortcuts, compact, dirty guard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Adaptive layout inference (radios, folding, tabs) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Nav links (`@LinkTo` / link supplier) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dashboard / Foldout / Welcome / ItemOverview archetypes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| UX components (MetricCard, Gantt, EmptyState, Skeleton…) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| i18n, events (emit/subscribe), security scaffolding | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Application context selector (`@AppContext`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Capture fields (`@Signature`, `@PhotoCapture`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tree selects (`@TreeSelect` + hierarchical options) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Smart-search listing filters (enums as multi-select, date/number ranges) | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 |
| — typed `DateRange`/`NumberRange`/`Set` filter fields, repository criteria | ✅ | — | — |
| Tree lookup selectors (`GridLayout.tree` + `Selector`) | ✅ | — | — |
| Lookup fields (`@Lookup` remote combobox + `search-<field>` action) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| — `@Searchable` full selector dialogs | ✅ | — | — |
| Editable grids / inline CRUD editing (`@InlineEditing` + update-row) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dialog/Drawer overlays from actions + `closeModal`/`dispatchEvent` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sticky sections index (`@Toc`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Client-side rules (`@Hidden(expr)`/`@Disabled`/rule supplier) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Grid form fields + `@OnRowSelected` row-click actions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-column layouts (`@Zones`, `@FoldedLayout`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Component adapters, federation/microfrontends, SSE/AI chat | ✅ | — | — |
| Hero search archetype | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

🟡 Smart-search filters on .NET/Python: the Crud entity's fields become the same filter widgets
(enums → multi-select IN, temporals → date ranges, `[RangeFilter]`/`RangeFilter()` numerics →
min–max) and the values are applied in-memory over `Fetch()`; Java's pluggable repository layer
(`find/4` criteria for DB pushdown) and declarative-Listing typed filters have no equivalent yet.

**Recent .NET/Python parity gains (2026-07-11)**: inline CRUD editing
(`[InlineEditing]`/`@inline_editing` — editable columns with typed in-place editors +
the update-row action rebuilding and saving the row), lookup fields (`[Lookup]`/`Lookup()` →
combobox + remoteCoordinates, the handler answers `search-<field>` from the options supplier,
filtered and paged), Dialog/Drawer overlays returned from actions (Add fragments on the initiator,
with `CloseModal`/`DispatchEvent` command factories carrying `{eventName, detail}`), `[Toc]`/`@toc`,
the full HeroSearch archetype (hero header + cards listing, starts empty), client-side rules
(`[Hidden(expr)]`/`[Disabled]` + `IRuleSupplier`/`RuleSupplier` → `ServerSideComponent.rules`),
grid form fields (list-of-rows properties → dataType `array` + stereotype `grid` + columns) with
`[OnRowSelected]`/`OnRowSelected()` injecting the clicked row into the handler method, and the
`[Zone]`/`@zones` + `[FoldedLayout]`/`@folded_layout` multi-column layouts. Earlier (2026-07-10):
CRUD search sorts and paginates; actions can return page banners, a `/route` or a UICommand.
Still Java-only on both backends: `@Searchable` selector dialogs, typed
`DateRange`/`NumberRange`/`Set` filters and tree lookup selectors (all need declarative
Listings/`Selector`, which the ports don't map yet), component adapters, semantic annotations and
federation/SSE.

## Renderers

Every renderer speaks the same wire; the depth of widget support varies.

| Feature | Vaadin (web) | Redwood (web) | SAP UI5 / PatternFly (web) | IntelliJ plugin | React Native |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Forms, CRUD, navigation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Smart-search filter bar (chips, ranges, multi-select) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (shared bar) | ✅ (native panel) | ✅ panel (ranges, multi-select, date pickers) |
| Sorting, cards/list/tree layouts, empty states | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (tree = JTree; cards/list adapt to the table) | ✅ |
| Inline editing (@InlineEditing, update-row) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (row form) | ✅ (row form) |
| Date picker | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (calendar popup) | ✅ (own calendar) |
| Remote lookup select (@Lookup / searchable) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Full field-stereotype set (radio, multiSelect, slider, stepper, stars, color, image upload, money, markdown…) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Client-side rules (visible/disabled/state) + \${...} interpolation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (shared engine) | ✅ (no-eval engine) |
| Page banners (@Banner + action-returned) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| FABs, header badges, KPIs, charts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (FABs as header buttons) | ✅ |
| @AutoSave / @SubscribeTo scopes / @OnRowSelected | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| AI chat (sseUrl) / theme toggle | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ chat (theme = the IDE's own) | ✅ |
| App context selector | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (shared) | ✅ (navigator combos) | ✅ |
| — searchable picker w/ remote search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 loaded options only | ✅ |
| Signature capture | ✅ canvas | ✅ canvas | ✅ (shared) | ✅ mouse canvas | ✅ svg + view-shot |
| Photo capture | ✅ getUserMedia | ✅ | ✅ (shared) | 🟡 file picker (no desktop camera API) | ✅ expo-camera |
| Tree select dropdown | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (shared) | ✅ (JTree popup) | ✅ |
| Tree lookup selector (dialog) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (shared) | ✅ (tree layout) | ✅ (tree layout) |
| Dashboards, Gantt, foldouts, skeletons | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dockable multi-tab workspace | — | — | — | ✅ (IDE editor tabs/splits) | — |
| App registry boot (installable → registry → backend) | — | — | — | ✅ (+ min IDE build gate) | ✅ |

🟡 PatternFly (redhat) & SLDS: as of 2026-07-10 both reuse the shared design-system-neutral
`<mateu-filter-bar>` (full smart-search) and the shared capture/tree field widgets
(`mateu-signature-pad`, `mateu-camera-capture`, `mateu-tree-select`) + money formatting, so those
stereotypes work. PatternFly still renders dashboards/gantt/foldout/hero as `<mateu-unsupported>`
placeholders (its `SUPPORTED_TYPES` is small); SLDS falls through to off-theme Vaadin components for
types its own switch misses. Both remain lighter than Vaadin/SAP UI5.

MessageList/MessageInput (Vaadin): as of 2026-07-10 these carry a real data model
(`List<MessageListItem>` / an `actionId` that fires on submit) — they were previously stubs that
rendered hardcoded demo data.

"Shared" = SAP UI5 and PatternFly reuse the shared web components (Lumo-variable theming), so they
inherit those features automatically.

Grids display collections of data.

## Example

```java
@UI("")
public class Users {

  List<User> users = userService.findAll();

}
```

Mateu renders a table automatically.

## Key idea

Collections = tables.

## Column widths

Annotate a column field with [`@ColumnWidth`](/java-ui-definition/annotations/layout/#columnwidth) to pin it to a fixed width. Columns with an explicit width no longer flex-grow, so the unannotated columns share the remaining space — annotate the narrow columns (codes, flags, dates) and leave the free-text column unannotated.

```java
record GuestRow(
    @ColumnWidth("9rem") String lastName,
    @ColumnWidth("4rem") String paxType,
    String observations            // no width → fills the rest
) {}
```

Use `@ColumnWidth("auto")` to make a column **size to its content** (header + widest cell) instead
of a fixed width. It never truncates and adapts to the current density, so it's the right choice for
short code/flag columns on a grid that is shown both in compact and non-compact screens (a fixed
`3rem` can truncate to `"A."` once the extra padding of a non-compact layout eats the width).

```java
record GuestRow(
    @ColumnWidth("9rem") String lastName,
    @ColumnWidth("auto") String paxType,   // as wide as "Pax" / "AD" needs
    @ColumnWidth("auto") String mealPlan,
    String observations                     // no width → fills the rest
) {}
```

## Row selection (`@OnRowSelected`)

Annotate a grid field with `@OnRowSelected("method")` to run a method when the user selects a row.
The selected row is auto-injected (typed as the row class), and it works on read-only grids — the
natural way to build a master/detail screen.

```java
@Stereotype(FieldStereotype.grid)
@OnRowSelected("onGuestSelected")
List<GuestData> guests;

Object onGuestSelected(GuestData guest, HttpRequest httpRequest) {
    return UICommand.dispatchEvent("pax-selected", guest.getCardex());
}
```

Add a `shortcut` base to select rows by position from the keyboard — the base combo plus a digit
selects that row (`ctrl+shift+1` → first row … up to the ninth; top-row digits or numeric keypad):

```java
@OnRowSelected(value = "onGuestSelected", shortcut = "ctrl+shift")
List<GuestData> guests;
```

## Inline editing (`@InlineEditing`)

By default, editing a row of an editable list opens a **separate detail form**. Annotate the list
field with `@InlineEditing` to edit the rows **directly in the grid cells** instead — no detail form,
no per-row "Edit" button.

```java
@InlineEditing
@Stereotype(FieldStereotype.grid)
List<OrderLine> lines;
```

Each column becomes an editable input based on its type — text field, number, checkbox, date picker;
a field marked `@ReadOnly` stays display-only. Edits travel back in the normal component state, so
they are **persisted when the enclosing form's next action runs** (a save/submit, or any developer
action that reads the list) — there is no per-cell save.

## Choosing the layout (`gridLayout()`)

A declarative listing (`extends Listing<Filters, Row>`) can force how its rows are laid out by overriding `gridLayout()`. By default the renderer picks a layout from the column weights (`GridLayout.auto`), which for a wide, many-column row can fall back to `masterDetail`. Return `GridLayout.table` (or `list`, `cards`) to force it:

```java
@UI("/arrivals")
public class Arrivals extends Listing<ArrivalFilters, ArrivalRow> {

    @Override
    public GridLayout gridLayout() {
        return GridLayout.table;   // always a classic table
    }

    @Override
    public ListingData<ArrivalRow> search(...) { ... }
}
```

A row class that drives a list/master-detail layout should mark its identifier column with `@Priority(value = 1, identifier = true)` so each row has a visible label.

## URL-based pagination and sorting

CRUD and listing pages sync their pagination, sort, and filter state to the browser URL. This means:

- Sharing or bookmarking a URL preserves the exact page, sort order, and active filters.
- Navigating back in the browser restores the previous listing state.
- Deep-linking directly to `?page=2&sort=name:asc` opens the listing at that page and sort.

The URL parameters are read automatically on component load; no extra code is needed in `search()`.

```
/customers?page=2&sort=lastName:asc
/orders?page=0&sort=createdAt:desc&status=PENDING
```

Query parameters that match filter field names in the `Filters` class are applied to the filter form as well.

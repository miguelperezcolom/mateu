As you are defining your UI using plain java classes, inheritance, dependency injection and maven packages can be 
used.

This means that you can extend existing UIs, forms or cruds, or create artifacts which contain component libraries
which can be used in another UI built with Mateu.

You can also integrate components from other microservices, as micro frontends in your own UI.

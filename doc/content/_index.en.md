**Mateu** empowers backend developers to build full-featured, responsive web applications—directly from their Java code. (Support for C# and Go is on the way.)

Forget about HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. With Mateu, you can create complex user interfaces using only Java (or other backend languages in the future), with minimal code and maximum speed.

Mateu is especially powerful for large-scale enterprise applications built by distributed teams. It’s designed to make UI development fast, reliable, and backend-friendly.

## 🎯 Why Mateu?

Mateu introduces a simple yet powerful UI Domain-Specific Language (DSL) through familiar Java constructs—interfaces, annotations, and classes. The goal: **build your UI with the fewest lines of code possible**, and let backend developers own the entire application lifecycle.

## 💡 Key Benefits

- 🚀 **Lightning-fast development**
- 🧩 **Frontend-agnostic architecture** (supports multiple frontends)
- 🎯 **Focus on business logic**, not UI plumbing
- 🔁 **Reusable, high-level UI components**
- 🛠️ **All the benefits of Java** — static typing, rich tooling, mature ecosystem
- 🌐 **Built for distributed systems** — stateless, microservice-friendly
- 🔌 **Embeddable anywhere** — UI delivered as web components

## 🤔 Why Not Just Use Vaadin?

Vaadin is a fantastic tool (we even use its design system!), but Mateu offers a different perspective:

| Feature                     | Vaadin                           | Mateu                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                  | UI components                    | Full application structure                 |
| **Architecture**           | Stateful                         | Stateless (ideal for microservices)        |
| **Microfrontend support**  | Indirect                         | First-class citizen                        |
| **Multi-language roadmap** | Java only                        | Java, C#, Go (planned)                     |
| **Frontend flexibility**   | Coupled                          | Fully decoupled and swappable              |

## 📦 Production-Proven

Mateu is already in production across multiple enterprise projects, powering complex UI systems with minimal development effort.

**Case Study:**  
At **Wefox**, Mateu was extended to seamlessly integrate with their corporate design system—demonstrating its flexibility and adaptability in real-world environments.

---

## 🛠️ Current Status: Version 3 in Development

Since May 2024, work has begun on **Mateu v3**, which includes:

- A cleaner, modular architecture
- Improved UX components
- More extension points
- Updated documentation and user manual
- Support for alternate design systems

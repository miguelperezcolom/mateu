**Mateu** is an open-source framework that lets backend developers create complete, responsive web applications using only backend code—no need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

With just Java (and soon C# and Python), you can design powerful user interfaces, define workflows, and deploy distributed applications that scale.

---

## 🎯 Why Mateu?

Mateu introduces a simple yet powerful UI Domain-Specific Language (DSL) through familiar Java constructs—interfaces, annotations, and classes. The goal: **build your UI with the fewest lines of code possible**, and let backend developers own the entire application lifecycle.

## 💡 Key Benefits

- 🚀 **Lightning-fast development**
- 🧩 **Frontend-agnostic architecture** (supports multiple frontends)
- 🎯 **Focus on business logic**, not UI plumbing
- 🔁 **Reusable, high-level UI components**
- 🛠️ **All the benefits of Java** — static typing, rich tooling, mature ecosystem
- 🌐 **Built for distributed systems** — stateless, microservice-friendly
- 🔌 **Embeddable anywhere** — UI delivered as web components

## 🤔 Why Not Just Use Vaadin?

Vaadin is a fantastic tool (we even use its design system!), but Mateu offers a different perspective:

| Feature                     | Vaadin                           | Mateu                               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                  | UI components                    | Full application structure          |
| **Architecture**           | Stateful                         | Stateless (ideal for microservices) |
| **Microfrontend support**  | Indirect                         | First-class citizen                 |
| **Multi-language roadmap** | Java only                        | Java, C#, Python (planned)          |
| **Frontend flexibility**   | Coupled                          | Fully decoupled and swappable       |

## 🛠️ Current Status: Version 3 in Development

Since May 2024, work has begun on **Mateu v3**, which includes:

- A cleaner, modular architecture
- Improved UX components
- More extension points
- Updated documentation and user manual
- Support for alternate design systems

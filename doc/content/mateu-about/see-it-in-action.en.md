To see Mateu in action just go to:

- https://demo.mateu.io for a component/feature explorer
- https://article2.mateu.io for a micro frontends example

Please notice that the demo app has been deployed to 2 pods inside a Kubernetes cluster running on infrastructure provided by Hetzner, and all that behind Cloudflare. This means that every request you do is load balanced between those 2 pods and that showcases the stateless nature of any UI built with Mateu :)

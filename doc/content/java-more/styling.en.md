You can provide inline styling for any component by using the **style** property.

You can also load your own stylesheets, either by providing your custom html or by adding stylesheets from
your java code, either declaratively or imperatively.

All the design systems used in Mateu provide also their own css variables, the default values of which you 
can easily override using css as explained at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties

E.g., for Vaadin design system you can find the list of available css variables at https://vaadin.com/docs/v25/styling/lumo/lumo-style-properties
while for the Red Hat  design system you can find the list of available css variables at https://ux.redhat.com/tokens/.

You create and run your Mateu UI on top of a Springboot/Micronaut/Quarkus/Helidon application, and all those frameworks 
provide mechanisms for serving static content.

You only need to follow their specific instructions. E.g. for springboot and micronaut you'll place them under the **static** folder
inside **resources**.

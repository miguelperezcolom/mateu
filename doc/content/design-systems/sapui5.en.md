I have always admired the SAP Fiori design system for its clean, modern look and its suitability for enterprise applications.

With Mateu, you can seamlessly integrate your UIs into any SAP web application that uses Fiori.

Please note that SAP Fiori is distributed under a proprietary license, so it can only be used if you are licensed for the SAP products that include it.

That said, only a small portion of the components I rely on come directly from Fiori. Most are based on UI5, which is open source. I plan to create a fork of the current frontend implementation that is purely UI5-based, replacing the proprietary Fiori components with open-source equivalents.

This approach will give you flexibility:

-	Use a **Fiori-based** frontend if you have the proper SAP license.
-	Or opt for the **UI5-based** frontend if you prefer a fully open-source solution.

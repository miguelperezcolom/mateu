I have always loved the SAP Fiori design system. It's clean and a perfect fit for any enterprise application.

By using this design system you should be able to easily integrate your UIs built with Mateu in any SAP web UI.

Please notice SAP Fiori is under a private license, so you can only use it in case you have the license for using 
the SAP products which include it.

However there are only a few components which belong to SAP Fiori, and most of the components that I use belong to the 
open source UI5. I will probably create a fork of this frontend implementations UI5 based only and will replace the 
proprietary SAP Fiori components by equivalent ones. That way you will be able to choose a SAP Fiori based frontend in
case you have the license, or the UI5 in case you want the open source version.

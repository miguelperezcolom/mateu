Mateu is currently being refactored. Due to dedication constraints there are some restrictions for the current version 3 (alpha):

- only **springboot/webflux** supported
- the documentation is not finished
- not fully covered by tests yet, so things can be broken at some point
- some features from version 1 are missing

I hope I will be able to bring it back to a complete production ready state by the beginning of 2025.

This [video](https://youtu.be/h_MSTvnN55o) shows an app built some time ago using version 2.
